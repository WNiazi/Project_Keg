## Description <a id="description"></a>

Build a tap room in React the store can track their kegs. Provide CRUD functionality.

- see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.
- submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
- be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
- see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
- click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it (decreasing by 1). Pints should not be able to go below 0.
- edit a keg's properties after entering them
- delete a keg
- with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
- update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
- kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price.
